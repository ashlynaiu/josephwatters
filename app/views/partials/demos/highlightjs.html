<h2>Easy Code Blocks For AngularJS</h2>
<p>
	When I'm reading through a "How-To" site or github repo my eyes are typically scanning for code blocks. We all know that the code blocks are where the honey is hiding and that the surrounding text is more of support material for when a copy and paste job doesn't do the trick. Having great looking code blocks like a finely tuned text editor isn't too difficult to get going on your own site. I'm currently using <a href="https://github.com/pc035860/angular-highlightjs">angular-highlightjs</a> to produce my code blocks within AngularJS.
</p>

<pre>
	<code class="hljs">
	public function hello($name) {
		echo ("Hello, $name");
	}
	</code>
</pre>

<p>
	To get started with this one I recommend just dropping in the highlightjs and angular-highlightjs script tags in your index and add hljs to your list of module dependencies.
</p>

<pre>
	<code class="hljs">
	// Add hljs to your app dependencies
	angular.module('myApp', ['hljs']);
	</code>
</pre>

<p>
	Create a new view to test whether the we loaded hljs correctly.
</p>

<pre>
	<code class="hljs">
	Testing my code block:
	<hljs>
		public function test() {
			echo "It Works!";
			echo "Soo pretty";
		}
	</hljs>
	</code>
</pre>

<p>
	If the modules loaded correctly you will see a code block loaded on the page, but it is likely not very pretty. Personally, I npm installed highlightjs and converted the css styles located in /node_modules/highlight.js/styles to SASS. This isn't necessary becuase can just navigate to the <a href="https://github.com/isagalaev/highlight.js/tree/master/src/styles">highlightjs style repo</a> to grep for the style you like.
